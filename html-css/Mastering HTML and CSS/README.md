## 4. CSS Fundamentals

### Q10: What are selectors in CSS, and how are they used?
**Answer**: Selectors target HTML elements to apply styles. Examples include element selectors (`p {}`), class selectors (`.class {}`), and ID selectors (`#id {}`).

### Q12: What is the box model in CSS?
**Answer**: The box model includes margins, borders, padding, and the content area, determining the space an element occupies.

### Q13: How do you use CSS for responsive design?
**Answer**: Implement media queries, flexible grids, percentages, and CSS Flexbox or Grid to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.

### Q14: What are CSS units, and how are they used?
**Answer**: CSS units like `px`, `%`, `em`, and `rem` define sizes and spacing, with `px` being absolute and `em/rem` relative to font size.

## 5. Advanced Topics

### Q16: What are pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements in CSS?
**Answer**: 
- Pseudo-classes (e.g., `:hover`, `:focus`) target special states of elements.
- Pseudo-elements (e.g., `::before`, `::after`) style specific parts of an element.

### Q17: How do you animate elements with CSS?
**Answer**: Use `@keyframes` to define animations and properties like `animation-name`, `animation-duration`, and `animation-iteration-count`.

### Q18: What is the difference between inline, internal, and external CSS?
**Answer**: 
- Inline: Styles within an element (`style="color:red;"`).
- Internal: Styles within a `<style>` tag in the `<head>`.
- External: Linked via a separate CSS file (`<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`).

### Q19: How do you integrate CSS with JavaScript for dynamic styling?
