## JS Library vs Framework


| **Criteria**               | **JavaScript Library**                                      | **JavaScript Framework**                                     |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**             | A collection of pre-written code snippets and functions that can be called to perform specific tasks. | A complete architecture that provides a structure and guidelines for building applications. |
| **Control Flow**           | The developer has control over the flow of the application. They decide when and how to use the library. | The framework often controls the flow. Developers insert their code into the framework structure. |
| **Flexibility**            | More flexible; allows you to pick and choose functions as needed. | Less flexible; you must follow the framework’s structure and conventions. |
| **Size and Scope**         | Smaller in size and scope, designed to do specific things. Examples: jQuery, Lodash. | Larger in scope, providing a full toolkit for building an application. Examples: Angular, React, Vue.js. |
| **Learning Curve**         | Generally easier to learn due to its focused nature. | Can have a steeper learning curve as it often requires understanding the whole framework. |
| **Usage**                  | Used for adding specific functionality to an existing application. | Used for building the entire architecture of the application. |
| **Dependence on Other Tools** | Can be used independently or with other libraries. | Often relies on or integrates with other tools and libraries for a full development environment. |
| **Updates and Maintenance**| Generally less frequent updates; easier to maintain and update. | More frequent updates; can require more effort to maintain and keep up with changes. |
| **Examples**               | jQuery, D3.js, Lodash, Moment.js | Angular, Vue.js, React (though React is sometimes considered a library, it’s often used as a framework). |
| **Community and Ecosystem**| Smaller community, fewer plugins, and extensions. | Larger community, extensive plugins, and extensions available. |
| **Use Case**               | Ideal for small projects or adding specific features. | Ideal for large-scale applications where a consistent structure is beneficial. |


## Client side frameworks

A client-side framework is a collection of tools and libraries that help developers build and manage the front-end of web applications. It handles user interface components, routing, and state management, running entirely in the browser.
